### 🌲 Welcome to my ReadMe! 🌲

My name is Sebastian Hernandez, a student at the University of Central Florida studying Computer Science. 👨🏻‍💻
I have been in school for quiet some time studying different fields like communication, business, and computer science. 

My GitHub will be a dynamic page where I share my projects and my journey to becoming the best software engineer I can be. ✨
